excerpt: "State of the Union, Visualization"

In the spirit of the U.S. presidential election (and me switching my voter registration from North Carolina to Washington, D.C.), I put together a wordcloud for every State of the Union address since I was born. While there are definitely better ways to visualize data, these wordclouds do a pretty good job of highlighting the key themes in the speeches.

For those interested, the Jupyter Notebook with code to scrape the speeches, clean the text, and make the wordclouds can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/beckernick/visualizations/tree/master/State_of_the_Union_Wordcloud) for this post.
