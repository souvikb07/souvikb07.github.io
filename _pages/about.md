I am an Electrical and Electronics Junior, with a thorough understanding and a keen interest in Data Science.

I've done some 30 odd courses on the topic of Data Analysis, Python, SQL, Machine Learning - covering the very best practices involved in it.

When I am not working or studying, I usually work for the student leg of the Rotary International - The Rotaract Club of New Delhi. I love making people smile and have spent several years working for non-profit organisations, doing my bit of social service.

I am a peopleâ€™s person - love meeting new people, talking about Data Science and learning new things that catch my fancy; please, feel free to say hello and share an anecdote with me!.
